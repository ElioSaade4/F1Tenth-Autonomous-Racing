# F1Tenth Lab 2: Emergency Braking

## Outline
In this lab, a safety node is developed to stop the car from crashing. Instateneous Time-to-Collision is calculated from laser scans and used to make a decision to brake or not.

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop

## Running the Lab
To run this lab, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to a local directory

2. Open **Docker Desktop**

3. Open a command prompt, and navigate to the cloned lab folder
```
cd C:\...\F1Tenth_Labs\LAB2-Emergency_Braking
```

4. Run the following command in the command prompt to build the needed docker images and start the container
```
docker-compose up --build
```

5. After the container is up and running, open a new command prompt and open a bash session inside the container with this command:
```
docker exec -it lab2-emergency_braking-sim-1 /bin/bash
```

7. In a web browser, open http://localhost:8080/vnc.html and click **Connect**

6. In the bash session, source the needed **ros** files by running these commands in order:
```
cd .. 
source opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
cd sim_ws 
colcon build
source install/local_setup.bash
```

7. Start **tmux** with 
```
tmux
```
This will allow you to open mutliple bash sessions from the same window. Use **ctrl+B - C** to open a new session. Use **ctrl+B - #** to navigate between the sessions with their number. 

8. In the first bash session, launch the gym environment
```
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```
In the second bash session, run the keyboard teleoperations node to be able to drive the car by pressing keyboard keys
```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
In the third bash session, run the safety node that will prevent the car from crashing
```
ros2 run safety_node safety_node
```

## Further Development
To modify the code, simply open the lab folder locally in **VSCode** and perform the changes. Then navigate to **sim_ws** in a bash session and run **colcon build**. This will re-build the ros packages using the updated code. Finally proceed to run the simulation environment as mentioned above. There is no need to stop the gym environment or the teleop keyboard to run **colcon build**.
